<h2>Bootcamp Introduction to Web Development Tools</h2>
<h1>MACAD BIM and Smart Construction 2022</h1>

<p>In this course you will learn about the basics of web development tools.</p>




<p>First you will learn about a tool for version control called <em>Git</em>, which 
can be extended to the web through a server for respositories called <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.
Along with it you will be introduce to the  glorified text editor <strong>Visual 
Studio Code</strong>, which allows you write and debug code in the browser through
a web server. </p>

<p>In the following sessions, you will learn the basics about the three main
components for modern web development:</p>

<ol>
    <li>HTML      </li>
    <li>CSS       </li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally (if we have enough time left), you will be introduced to Github Pages,
a feature that will allow you to host your sites in the web through Github.</p>
