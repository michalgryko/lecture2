<h2 id = "top">  Bootcamp Introduction to Web Development Tools</h2>
<h1>MACAD BIM and Smart Construction 2022</h1>

<p class="special-items">In this course you will learn about the basics of web development tools.</p>




<p id="nice">First you will learn about a tool for version control called <em>Git</em>, which 
can be extended to the web through a server for respositories called <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.
<b>Along with it you will be introduce to the  glorified text editor <strong>Visual 
Studio Code</strong>, which allows you write and debug code in the browser through
a web server. </b></p>

<p>In the following sessions, you will learn the basics about the three main
components for modern web development:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href ="#html">HTML  </a>    </li>
    <li><a href = "#css">CSS  </a>     </li>
    <li><a href = "#javascript">Javascript </a> </li>
</ol>

<p>Finally (if we have enough time left), you will be introduced to Github Pages,
a feature that will allow you to host your sites in the web through Github.</p>
